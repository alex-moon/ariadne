Concurrency and Synchronisation: Finding a Way
----------------------------------------------

Originally presented at Tangent Labs, 18 December 2013

Slides: [http://slid.es/formsatz/concurrency](http://slid.es/formsatz/concurrency)

Instructions
------------

``a1.go``, ``a2.go`` and ``a3.go`` correspond respectively to **First Attempt**, **Second Attempt** and **Third Attempt** in the slides.

Most of the code is a half-hearted implementation of the Knuth-Welford Online Standard Deviation for a list of terms. To see the important bits try:

    diff a1.go a2.go
    diff a2.go a3.go
